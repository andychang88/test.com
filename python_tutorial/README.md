A Beginner's Python Tutorial
============================

Here lies my beloved Python tutorial. It has been published, source and all, so
that it might *finally* be fully corrected/updated/relevant.

While I have previously guarded 'ownership' of the tutorial (and, according to
the LICENSE, I am still the copyright holder), the fact is that the wider
software community can be a much better custodian of its content than can I.

I still intend on hosting this tutorial on http://sthurlow.com/python/ - it
ain't going anywhere. Re-skins/corrections/expansions might all be uploaded. It
is currently MIT (see LICENSE.mit) and Creative Commons Attribution Australia
(see LICENSE.cc-by) licensed - take your pick.

So. It has come to this. Fork me, biatches!

##FAQ

###Your code is awful and you suck.

That's not a question, but okay. I acknowledge that this code is awful, and as
a high school kid learning programming, I sucked at many things. But that's
where you can help! You could help fix one of many things:

* The styling
* The code formatting
* The absent DOCTYPE
* The strange XML-ish intermediary format
* The typographical errors
* The missing content
* The sometimes awkward phrases (though this is supposed to be *fun*, y'know)

###What can I do to it?

Whatever you want, within the License.

###What are you going to do?

I will continue to host the site. I will obviously security review the code
before publishing. I may contribute to any of the aforementioned things that
need fixing. However, it's been years (and dozens of ignored emails) since
I've touched this, so if yesterday's weather holds true, well, you know what
to expect.
